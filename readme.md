# Personal Configuration

Minimalist configuration, I don't wanna miss. Maybe you find something useful.

## How to use it

```sh
git clone git://github.com/einsichten/pers_config && cd pers_config
./install
```

The `install` command is copying custom commands and configuration files. Look into it. If you have corresponding configuration files in place, it asks you for overwrite. Maybe you just want to append. All files are **not** meant to be used, without looking at them in detail.

After copying, you may want to change the files, and read them back to the repository directory:

```sh
./install --reverse
```

Have fun!
